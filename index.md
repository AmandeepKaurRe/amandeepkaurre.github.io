I am Amandeep Kaur (Reehal), a PhD student at [ASU](https://www.asu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/). Currently, i'm interested in studying the impacts of data distribution of large volumes of pretraining data used in Foundational models, specifically GeoFoundational models.

Previously, as part of Google Deepmind, I was working on AMED(Agricultural Monitoring and Event Detection), creating ML/DL models to generate pan-India crop covers 
for top-10 Indian crops using Sentinel1-2, under the guidance of [Alok Talekar](https://research.google/people/106902/?&type=google) and 
[Dr. Gaurav Aggarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9XiIwDQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Before Google, I was at IIIT-D,
pursuing my Bachelor's in CSE where I first got into research. I had the pleasure of working with [Dr Rahul Purandare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_OLz-J0AAAAJ&hl=en) 
in the summer of my 2nd year. Then under the guidance of [Dr. Jainendra Shukla](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=QCZleNQAAAAJ&hl=en), I did an independent project where 
I created a system to collect audio speech samples from Indian students for our project on improving English pronunciation of Indian students. As part of my Bachelor's Thesis, 
I worked on improving a head gesture guided typing system for people with limited body motion, under the supervision 
of [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=WAChZv4AAAAJ&hl=en).
